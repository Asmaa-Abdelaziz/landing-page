# Landing Page Project

This is the first project on Udacity FWD professional web, it's about adding sections to the landning page and use navigation bar to smooth scrolling into this sections using JavaScript.

I added more sections using HTML.

## Smooth scrolling

I used scrollIntoView() & scrollTo() with behavior smooth for smooth scrolling into this page.

## Section Active State

I used IntersectionObserver not getBoundingClientRect() as it sometimes leads to performance problems.

## Navigation Bar

created automatically using JavaScript function that added active link for each section to navigate for.

## button

I added button at the bottom of page for scrolling to the top of page smoothly.
